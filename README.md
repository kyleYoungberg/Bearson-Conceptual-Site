# Bearson-Conceptual-Site
A conceptual site as part of a conceptual brand idenity for the band Bearson

Bearson Website
Goals I accomplished:
To make a website as a continued part of making a conceptual brand identity for a band and make the website consistent with the rest of the brand identity for the band

Things that I would change:
The items in each section are a little too compressed from the sides so they don't line up quite right with their respective headers
The album cover image twice gets distorted, once on the home page and once on the store
Add hover effects when someone hovers over the upcoming tour dates images
Make the size of the bear image depend on screen size so you can always see the whole thing when you go to the home page
Spread the items in the footer out to either side and give them more space form the rest of the content
Make the image of Bearson larger
Remove the style guide from the store (though I'm pretty sure this was just a requirement for the assignment when I turned it in)
